# SmartSweepers4j
This is a port of the C++ Smart Sweepers from http://www.ai-junkie.com

It is a program to simulate the evolution of tanks which sweep mines. For this it uses a genetic algorithm to select the fittest tanks from one generation.
The direction in which a tank is heading is processed using a neural network.

With f you can toggle between visual mode and fast mode.

To alter the behavior and evolution you can change the settings in res/params.ini
